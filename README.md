### What I learned

I had a bit of a hard time with positioning of the component container! So, with this I was able to learn how to center a div vertically and horizontally without using Flexbox!


```css

.qr-container {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 400px;
    width: 50%;
    margin: auto;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    position: absolute;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
